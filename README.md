ispCP Omega config files for Arch Linux
=======================================

These configuration files are needed to install [ispCP Omega][0] on to Arch Linux.

You don't need to directly interact with all these files, an [AUR PKGBUILD][1]
which automatically deploy all these files has been created to build an install
package for Arch Linux. You just need to download the PKGBUILD and makepkg it,
or you can let one of the [AUR helpers][2] take care of all the downloading and
makepkging stuff. I prefer [yaourt][3].

For more installation details, please refer to this [Arch Wiki Page][4].

As for now, Arch Linux has not been officially supported by ispCP project, this
git repo will exist until that day coming.
